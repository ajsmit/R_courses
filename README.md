This repository houses AJ Smit's R Courses website on [Netlify](https://ajsmit.netlify.app/). This is a website about applications of R in the Earth and Biological Sciences. Several R courses taught at the University of the Western Cape Biological & Conservation Biology Department are kept here, viz. Introduction to R, Biostatistics, and Quantitative Ecology. In addition to the taught material, there are also pages with some R tricks I have learned over the years, including examples of how to analyse oceanographic datasets.
