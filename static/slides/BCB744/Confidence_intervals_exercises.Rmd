a. Using the Lung Capacity data, please calculate the 95% CIs for the `LungCap` variable as a function of:

    i. `Gender`
    
    ii. `Smoke`
    
    iii. `Caesarean`
    
b. Create a graph of the mean Â± 95% CIs (as I have done in the above example), and determine if there are statistical differences in `LungCap` between the levels of `Gender`, `Smoke`, and `Caesarean`. Do the same using a *t*-test. Are your findings the same using these two approaches?

c. Produce all the associated tests for assumptions -- i.e. the assumptions to be met when deciding on which *t*-test to use, or whether you should apply the 'traditional' or bootstrapping approach in the calculation of CIs.

.right-column[
* Create a combined tidy dataframe (observe tidy principles) with the estimates for the 95% CI for the teacher data, above, estimated using both the traditional and bootstrapping methods. Create a plot comprising two panels (one for the traditional estimates, one for the bootstrapped estimates) of the mean, median, scatter of raw data points, and the upper and lower 95% CI.

* Load a new dataset and create a Harrell plot from it based on values of your choosing. What does the Harrell plot show?
