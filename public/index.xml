Data The detect_event() function is the core of this package, and it expects to be fed the output of the second core function, ts2clm(). By default, ts2clm() wants to receive a two-column dataframe with one column labelled t containing all of the date values, and a second column temp containing all of the temperature values. Please note that the date format it expects is “YYYY-MM-DD”.</description>

  “Without data you’re just another person with an opinion.”
— W. Edwards Deming
 Setting up the workspace General settings Before we start using RStudio (which is a code editor and environment that runs R) let’s first set it up properly. Find the ‘Tools’ (‘Preferences’) menu item, navigate to ‘Global Options’ (‘Code Editing’) and select the tick boxes as shown in the figure below.</description>

      <description>This material also appears as a heatwaveR vignette.
Overview In this vignette we will see how to retrieve and prepare Reynolds optimally interpolated sea surface temperature (OISST) data for calculating marine heatwaves (MHWs). The OISST product is a global 1/4 degree gridded dataset of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) derived SSTs at a daily resolution, starting on 1 September 1981. The source of the data is currently the NOAA NCDC.</description>

      <description>“The plural of anecdote is not data.”
— Roger Brinner
 In this chapter we will, firstly, recap how to work with data in R. Then we will look at the different kinds of biological and environmental data that are typically encountered by most biologists. The data seen here are not an exhaustive list of all the various types of data out there, but it should represent the bulk of our needs.</description>

      <description>Three measures of biodiversity Three measures of biodiversity were coined by Whittaker in 1972. They represent the measurement of biodiversity across different spatial scales. α- and γ-diversity simply express the total number of species in an area. α-diversity is a representation of the number of species at the small (local) scale, such as within a quadrat, transect, plot, or trawl. Multiples of these are nested within a larger region (or ecosystem etc.</description>

      <description>“I think it is much more interesting to live with uncertainty than to live with answers that might be wrong.”
—- Richard Feynman
 In this Chapter we will focus on basic descriptions of the data, and these initial forrays are built around measures of the central tendency of the data (the mean, median, mode) and the dispersion and variability of the data (standard deviations and their ilk). The materials covered in this and the next two chapters concern a broad discussion that will aid us in understanding our data better prior to analysing it, and before we can draw inference from it.</description>

      <description>In the previous two sections we looked at calculations involving biodiversity (specifically the dissimilarity matricies made from a species table) and environmental variables (distances). What can we do with the two forms of contemporary β-diversity? What do they mean? Can we look to environmental distances for more insight?
Let’s do a deeper analysis and create a figure to demonstrate these findings. I regress \(\beta_{\text{sør}}\) on the spatial distance between section pairs (see below) and on the environmental distance (\(\beta_{\text{E}}\)) in each bioregion and used the magnitude of the slope (per 100 km) of this relationship as a metric of β-diversity or ‘distance decay’ of dissimilarity.</description>

We use ggplot2 for these figures and will refrain from using the base R graphs. We shall provide examples of various themes so you can see what is available to use for your own plots. We also include various modifications of the default plots so you can get an idea of how to modify some of the plot characteristics, and we always make sure that our graphs are publication ready.</description>

      <description>We have already covered all the necessary theory in Topic 3 - Biodiversity. The dissimilarity matrices that capture α-diversity and the contemporary measures of β-diversity are in fact the same species dissmimilarity matrices I refer to in Topic 5, and on which we will continue to rely on in the subsequent topics as input to many of the ordination techniques.
So, refer back to Topic 3 - Biodiversity and remind yourselves what that’s all about.</description>

      <description>“Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.”
— Oscar Wilde
  “If you could say it in words, there would be no reason to paint.”
— Edward Hopper
 Now that we have seen the basics of ggplot2, let’s take a moment to delve further into the beauty of our figures. It may sound vain at first, but the colour palette of a figure is actually very important.</description>

      <description>“He uses statistics as a drunken man uses lamp posts—for support rather than for illumination.”
— Marissa Mayer
 Whole big books have been written about Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Although there are many ANOVA experimental designs available, biologists are taught to pay special attention to the design of experiments, and generally make sure that the experiments are fully factorial (in the case of two-way or higher ANOVAs) and balanced.</description>

 Yesterday we learned how to create ggplot2 figures, change their aesthetics, labels, colour palettes, and facet/arrange them. Now we are going to look at how to create maps.
Most of the work that we perform as environmental/biological scientists involves going out to a location and sampling information there. Sometimes only once, and sometimes over a period of time.</description>

      <description>Regressions test the statistical significance of the dependence of one continuous variable on one or many independent continuous variables.
The simple linear regression equation The linear regression equation is already known to you. It is:
\[y_{n}=\beta \cdot x_{n}+\alpha+\epsilon\]
Coefficients are parameters (statistics) that describe two properties of the linear line that best fit a scatter plot between a dependent variable and the independent variable. The dependent variable, \(y_{1..n}\), may also be called the response variable, and the independent variable, \(x_{1.</description>

      <description>A correlation is performed when we want to investigate the potential association between two continuous quantitative variables, or between some ordinal variables. We assume that the association is linear, like in a linear regression, and that one variable increases or decreases by a constant amount for a corresponding unit increase or decrease in the other variable. This does not suggest that one variable explains the other – that is the purpose of regression, as seen in the previous Chapter.</description>

      <description>PCA is one of many ordination techniques. Depening on the application of technical/scientific discipline it is applied in, you might see it mentioned under ‘dimensionality reduction’ techniques; other times it is named as a form of ‘unsupervised learning.’ Regardless of what it is called, ordination refers to multivariate techniques that reduces a multivariate (multi-dimensional) dataset in such a way that when it is projected onto a lower dimensional space, typically 2D or 3D space, any intrinsic structure in the data forms visually-discernable patterns (Pielou, 1984).</description>

      <description>A confidence interval (CI) tells us within what range we may be certain to find the true mean from which any sample has been taken. If we were to repeatedly sample the same population over and over and calculated a mean every time, the 95% CI indicates the range that 95% of those means would fall into.

      <description>Paranormal distribution
 Assumptions Throughout the preceding sections I have stressed the importance of testing the assumptions underly- ing some statistical tests, in particular t-tests, ANOVAs, regressions, and correlations. These statistics are called parametric statistics and they require that the assumption of normality and homogeneity of vari- ances are met. This is the kind of statistic you would normally be required to calculate, and because they are commonly used, most people are familiar with parametric statistics.</description>

      <description>CA is an eigenvalue method that can be applied to calculate the degree of ‘correspondence’ between the rows and columns of a presence-absence or abundance species table. We say that CA maximises the correspondence between species scores and sample scores, whereas a PCA maximises the variance explained. The technique is best applied to a species dataset where the species (in the columns) show unimodal distributions across sites (down the rows).</description>

      <description>Rather than using raw data as in a CA, PCoA takes a (dis)similarity matrix as input; in other words, any of the dissimilarities calculated by vegan’s vegdist() function can be used, which is great as they are well-suited to species data. If dissimilarities are Euclidean distances, then PCoA is equal to PCA. Another thing that makes a PCoA more useful is that (dis)similarity matrices calculated from quantitative, semi-quantitative, qualitative, and mixed variables can be handled.</description>

      <title>11a. non-Metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS)</title>

      <guid>/collection/quantecol/chapters/11-nmds/</guid>
      <description>nMDS is a rank-based indirect gradient analysis (i.e. not an eigen-analysis) that uses a distance or dissimilarity matrix as input. Whereas the ordination methods discussed thus far try to maximise the variance or correspondence between sites, nMDS strives to represent pairwise dissimilarities between sites in ordination space. It does not use the distances or dissimilarities directly (hence indirect), but these are substituted with their ranks (e.g. dissimilarities between pairs of sites are ordered by rank) (and hence non-metric in the name).</description>

      <description>Kelp forests are known to host a large biomass of epiphytic fauna and flora, including diatoms, which constitute the base of aquatic food webs and play an important role in the transfer of energy to higher trophic levels. Epiphytic diatom assemblages associated with two common species of South African kelps, Ecklonia maxima and Laminaria pallida, were investigated in this study. Primary blades of adult and juvenile thalli of both kelp species were sampled at False Bay in July 2017 and analysed using scanning electron microscopy.</description>

      <description>Please note that the following chapter departs from the syntax employed by the tidyverse, as utilised throughout this workshop, in favour of the base R syntax. This may be changed in the future, but has been left for now in order to better highlight the fundamental machinations of the R language, upon which the tidyverse is based.
Dataframes The ‘workhorse’ data-containing structures you will use extensively in R are called dataframes.</description>

      <description>Up to now we have applied indirect gradient analyses. The lecture slides mention several constrained ordinations and provide some theory for three of them, viz. Redundancy Analysis (RDA), Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA), and distance-based Reducndancy Analysis (db-RDA). Constrained ordination is sometimes called ‘direct gradient analysis’.
Constrained ordination is used to extract and summarise the variation in a set of response variables (species data in the case of ecology) that can be explained by some explanatory variables (‘constraints’), such as measurements of environmental properties at the places where the species data were collected from.</description>

      <description>“There are two types of people in the world: 1) those who extrapolate from incomplete data.” – Anon.
 We have seen that the WHO/SDG data seem to form neat groupings of countries within their respective parent locations. In this exercise we will apply a cluster analysis called ‘Partitioning Around Medoids’ to these data. Whereas ordination attempts to display the presence and influence of gradients, clustering tries to place our samples into a certain number of discrete units or clusters.</description>
