In this Chapter we will explore how biodiversity is structured.

## Coenoclines, coenoplanes and coenospaces

A **coenocline** is a graphical display of *all species* response curves (see definition, below) *simultaneously* along one environmental gradient. It aids our understanding of the species response curve if we imgine the gradient operating in only one geographical direction. The **coenoplane** concept extends the coenocline to cover two gradients. Again, our visual respresentation can be facilitated if the two gradients are visualised orthogonal (in this case, at right angles) to each other (e.g. east--west and north--south) and they do not interact. A **coenospace** complicates the model substantially, as it can allow for an unspecified number of gradients to operate simulataneously on multiple species at once, and it will probably also capture interactions of environmental drivers on the species.

### Species response curves

Plotting the abundance of a species as a function of position along a gradient is called a **species response curve**. If a long enough gradient is sampled, a species typically has a *unimodal* response (one peak *resembling* a Gaussian distribution) to the gradient. Although the idealised Gaussian response is desired (for statistical purposes, largely), in nature the curve might deviate quite noticeably from what's considered ideal. It is probable that a perfect normal species distribution along a gradient can only be expected when the gradient is perfectly linear in magnitude (seldom true in nature), operates along only one geographical direction (unlikely), and that all other potentially additive environmental influences are constant across the ecological (coeno-) space (also not a realistic expectation).

### Unimodal species response

The **unimodal** model is an idealised species reponse curve (visualised as a coenocline) where a species has only one mode of abundance. The unimodel model offers a convenient heuristic tool for understanding how species can become structured along environmental gradients. In this type of species response curve the species has one optimal environmental condition where it is most abundant (fewest ecophysiological and ecological stressors). If any aspect of the environment is suboptimal (greater or lesser than the optimum), the species will perform more poorly and it will have a lower abundance.

The R package **coenocliner** implements the unimodal (and also a beta response model, not covered in the module). Please see the implementation of [**coenocliner** by Gavin Simpson](https://fromthebottomoftheheap.net/2014/07/31/simulating-species-abundance-data-with-the-coenocliner-package/), the author of the package. Download and install the package, and play around with its functionality in order to gain deeper insight into how gradients can structure communities (i.e., sort species).

## Macroecological patterns

We have seen the distribution of one or several species along gradients, but lets extend the view to ecological patterns. Let's develop views that are based on all the information contained in the species tables, i.e. abundance, the number of sites, and the diversity of the biota. This deeper view is not necessarily captured if we limit our toolkit to species response curves (but they are certainly also counted, below).

Some of you will be familiar with the paper by Shade et al. (2018). Several kinds of ecological patterns are mentioned in the paper, and they can be derived from a species table with abundance data (but *not* presence-absence data!) such as this mites dataset used extensively in the Numerical Ecology with R book:

Note that Figure 1 in Shade et al. (2018) starts with a species table where the species are arranged down the rows and the sites along the variables (columns). I, and also the **vegan** package, require that the **species are along the variables and the sites down the rows**. This is the convention that will be used throughout this module.

The patterns that can be derived from such a table include:

* species-abundance distribution;
* occupancy-abundance curves;
* species-area curves;
* distance-decay curves;
* rarefaction curves;
* elevation gradients.
