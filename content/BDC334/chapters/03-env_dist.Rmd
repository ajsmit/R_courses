## Set up the analysis environment

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(vegan)
library(ggplot2)
library(geodist) # for calculating geographical distances between lats/lons
library(ggpubr) # to arrange the multipanel graphs

# setting up a 'root' file path so I don't have to keep doing it later...
root <- "../../../static/BDC334/data/"
```

## Revisiting Euclidian distance

The toy data have arbitrary columns to demonstrate the Euclidean distance calculation in the lecture slides:

$$ d(a,b) = \sqrt{(a_x - b_x)^2 + (a_y - b_y)^2 + (a_z - b_z)^2} $$

The distance is found between every pair of sites named ***a*** to ***g*** whose locations are marked by the 'coordinates' $x$, $y$, and $z$---i.e. this is an example of 3-dimensional data (a space or volume, as opposed to 2D data situated on a $x$, $y$ place). We might also call each coordinate a 'variable' (sometimes called a 'dimension') and hence we have multivariate or multidimensional data.

Let's load the dataset and find the size of the dataframe:

```{r}
xyz <- read.csv(paste0(root, "Euclidian_distance_demo_data_xyz.csv"))
dim(xyz)
```

There are seven rows and four columns.

The data look like:

```{r}
xyz
```

The first column contains the site names and it must be excluded from subsequent calculations. The remaining three columns will be used below.

Calculate the Euclidean distance using **vegan**'s `vegdist()` function and view the lower triangle with the diagonal:

```{r}
xyz_euc <- round(vegdist(xyz[, 2:4], method = "euclidian",
                         upper = FALSE, diag = TRUE), 4)
# selected only cols 2, 3 and 4
xyz_euc
```

Convert to a dataframe and view it:

```{r}
xyz_df <- as.data.frame(round(as.matrix(xyz_euc), 4))
xyz_df
```

Distance matrices have the same properties as dissimilarity matrices, i.e.:

i.  The distance matrix is square (number rows = number columns).

ii. The diagonal is filled with 0.

iii. The matrix is symmetrical---it is comprised of symmetrical upper and lower triangles.

In terms of the meaning of the cell values, their interpretation is also analogous with that of the species dissimilarities. A value of 0 means the properties of the sites (or sections, plots, transects, quadrats, etc.) in terms of their environmental conditions are identical (this is always the case the the diagonal). The larger the number (which may be \>1) the more different sites are in terms of their environmental conditions.

Since each column, $x$, $y$, and $z$, is a variable, we can substitute them for *actual* variables or properties of the environment within which species are present. Let's load such data (again fictitious):

```{r}
env_fict <- read.csv(paste0(root, "Euclidian_distance_demo_data_env.csv"))
head(env_fict, 2) # print first two rows only
```

These are the same data as in `Euclidian_distance_demo_data_xyz.csv` but I simply renamed the columns to names of the variables temperature, depth, and light intensity. I won't repeat the analysis here as the output remains the same.

Now apply `vegdist()` as before. The resultant distances are called 'environmental distances'.

Let us now use some real data.

## A look at the seaweed environmental data

These data accompany the analysis of the South African seaweed flora (see Smit et al. 2017).

```{r}
load(paste0(root, "SeaweedEnv.RData"))

# lets look at the data
dim(env)
```

We see that the data have 58 rows and 18 columns... the same number of rows as the `seaweed.csv` data. What is in the first five rows?

```{r}
round(env[1:5, 1:5], 4)
```

And the last five rows?

```{r}
round(env[(nrow(env) - 5):nrow(env), (ncol(env) - 5):ncol(env)], 4)
```

So, each of the rows corresponds to a site (i.e. each of the coastal sections), and the columns each contains an environmental variable. The names of the environmental variables are:

```{r}
colnames(env)
```

As we have seen, there are 18 variables (or dimensions). These data are truly multidimensional in a way that far exceeds our brains' limited ability to spatially visualise. For mathematicians these data define an 18-dimensional space, but all we can do is visualise 3-dimensions.

We select only some of the thermal variables; the rest are collinear with some of the ones I import:

```{r}
  env1 <- dplyr::select(env, febMean, febRange, febSD, augMean,
                    augRange, augSD, annMean, annRange, annSD)
```

Let us make a quick graph of `annMean` as a function of distance along the coast:

```{r fig.cap = "Line plot showing the trend in the mean annual seawater temperature along the coast from the west at Section 1 to Section 58 in the East."}
ggplot(env1, aes(x = 1:58, y = annMean)) +
  geom_line(col = "red") +
  labs(x = "Coastal section (west to east)",
       y = "Temperature (°C)")
```

## Calculate *z*-scores

Here we need to do something new that was not necessary with the toy data. We calculate *z*-scores, and the process is called 'standardisation'. Standardisation is necessary when the variables are measured in diffrent units---e.g. the unit for temperature is °C whereas Ch-*a* is measured in mg Chl-*a*/m3.

```{r}
E1 <- round(decostand(env1, method = "standardize"), 4)
E1[1:5, 1:5]
```

For comparison with the previous plot showing the raw data, let us now plot the standardised `annMean` data:

```{r fig.cap = "Line plot showing the trend in the standardised mean annual seawater temperature along the coast from the west at Section 1 to Section 58 in the East."}
ggplot(E1, aes(x = 1:58, y = annMean)) +
  geom_line(col = "red") +
  labs(x = "Coastal section (west to east)",
       y = "Standardised temperature")
```

## Calculate Euclidian distance

```{r}
E1_euc <- round(vegdist(E1, method = "euclidian", upper = TRUE), 4)
E1_df <- as.data.frame(as.matrix(E1_euc))
E1_df[1:10, 1:10]
```

We already know how to read this matrix. Let's plot it as a function of the coastal section's number:

```{r fig.cap = "Line plot showing the trend in environmental distance along the coast from the west at Section 1 to Section 58 in the East."}
ggplot(data = E1_df, (aes(x = 1:58, y = `1`))) +
  geom_line() +
  xlab("Coastal section, west to east") +
  ylab("Environmental distance")
```

We will explore distance and dissimilarity matrices in more detail in later sections.

## Calculate pairwise correlations

It is easy to calculate pairwise correlation matrices for the above data:

```{r}
env1_cor <- round(cor(env1), 2)
env1_cor
```

### Lab 2 Tasks

> **Task 1:** Explain in s short (1/3 page paragraph) what is meant by 'environmental distance'.
>
> **Task 2:** Describe to your grandmother how to interpret the above correlation matrix, and also mention what the major conclusions are that can be drawn from studying the matrix. Add a mechanistic explanation to demonstrate to her what your thought processes are for reaching your conclusion.
>
> **Task 3:** Explain why the same general trend is seen in the raw or standardised environmental data for `annMean` (Figure 1 and 2) and that of envirnomental distance (Figure 3).

## Euclidian distance of geographical data

When we calculate Euclidian distances between geographic lat/lon coordinate, the relationship between sections will be the same (but scaled) as actual geographic distances.

```{r}
geo <- read.csv(paste0(root, "sites.csv"))
dim(geo)
```

```{r}
head(geo)
```

<!--- The first column contains nonsense and must be removed: --->

Calculate geographic distances (in meters) between coordinate pairs:

```{r}
dists <- geodist(geo, paired = TRUE, measure = "geodesic")
dists_df <- as.data.frame(as.matrix(dists))
colnames(dists_df) <- seq(1:58)
dists_df[1:5, 1:5]
```

```{r}
plt1 <- ggplot(data = dists_df, (aes(x = 1:58, y = `1`/1000))) +
  geom_line() +
  xlab("Coastal section, west to east") +
  ylab("Distance (km)") +
  ggtitle("Actual geographic distance")
```

```{r}
dists_euc <- vegdist(geo, method = "euclidian")
dists_euc_df <- round(as.data.frame(as.matrix(dists_euc)), 4)
dists_euc_df[1:5, 1:5]
```

```{r}
plt2 <- ggplot(data = dists_euc_df, (aes(x = 1:58, y = `1`))) +
  geom_line() +
  xlab("Coastal section, west to east") +
  ylab("Euclidian distance") +
  ggtitle("Euclidian distance")
```

```{r}
ggarrange(plt1, plt2, nrow = 2)
```

### Lab 2 Tasks

> **Task 4:** Do a full analysis of the Doubs River environmental data using Euclidian distances and correlations. Demonstrate graphically any clear spatial patterns that you might find, and offer a full suite of mechanistic explanations for the patterns you see. It is sufficient to submit a fully annotated R script (not a MS Word or Excel file).

#### Take note

The Lab 2 assignment on Ecological Data was discussed on Monday 8 August and is due at **07:00 on Monday 15 August 2022**.

Provide a **neat and thoroughly annotated** R file which outlines the graphs and all calculations and which displays the resultant distance matrix. Written answers must be typed in the same file as comments. 

Please label the R files as follows:

* **BDC334_<first_name>_<last_name>_Assignment_2.R**

(the '<' and '>' must be omitted as they are used in the example as field indicators only).

Submit your appropriately named R documents on iKamva when ready.

Failing to follow these instructions carefully, precisely, and
thoroughly will cause you to lose marks, which could cause a significant
drop in your score as formatting counts for 15% of the final mark (out
of 100%).
