# BDC334 Labs

The Practical (or Labs) material for the BDC334 module appears here. Not all material is yet available online, but it will be added systematically as we work through the module each week.

Please use the links below to access the Labs. Lab 1 starts in the second week of the module in Term 3. You have until the following Monday 07:00 to complete all the material.

[Lab 1](/BDC334/pages/01-introduction.html)

Please ensure that you read through each Lab before the start of our face-to-face session in the Life Science Computer Lab at 13:10 on Mondays.

Labs are compulsory and failing to attend will result in a penalty of 20% taken from your mark for the week.

# Expectations
## Computers

You are encouraged to provide your own laptops and to install the neccesary software before the module starts. Limited support can be provided if required. There are also computers with R and RStudio (and the neccesary add-on libraries) available in the 5th floor lab in the BCB Department.
## Attendance

These Labs are hands on. They can only deliver acceptible outcomes if you attend all Lab sessions. The schedule is set and cannot be changed. Sometimes an occasional absence cannot be avoided, but you need to provide evidence (affidavit, doctor's note, or death certificate) for why you did not attend in order to avoid a non-attendance penalty. Please be curtious and notify myself or the tutor in advance of any absence. If you work with a partner in class, notify them too. Keep up with the reading assignments while you are away and we will all work with you to get you back up to speed on what you miss. If you do miss a class, however, the assignments must still be submitted on time (also see [**Late submission of CA**](/bdc334/#late-submission-of-ca)).

Since you may decide to work in collaboration with a peer on tasks and assignments, please keep this person informed at all times in case some emergency makes you unavailable for a period of time. Someone might depend on your input and contributions---do not leave someone in the lurch so that they cannot complete a task in your absence.
## Late submission of CA

Late assignments will be penalised 10% per day late and will not be accepted more than 48 hours late, unless evidence such as a doctor's note, a death certificate, or another documented emergency can be provided. If you know in advance that a submission will be late, please discuss this and seek prior approval. This policy is based on the idea that in order to learn how to translate your human thoughts into computer language (coding) you should be working with them at multiple times each week---ideally daily. Time has been allocated in class for working on assignments and students are expected to continue to work on the assignments outside of class. Successfully completing (and passing) this module requires that you finish assignments based on what we have covered in class by the following class period. Work diligently from the onset so that even if something unexpected happens at the last minute you should already be close to done. This approach also allows rapid feedback to be provided to you, which can only be accomplished by returning assignments quickly and punctually.
