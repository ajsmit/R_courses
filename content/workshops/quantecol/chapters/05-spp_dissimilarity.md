<!--- # Topic 5: Species dissimilarities --->

We have already covered all the necessary theory in Topic 3 - Biodiversity. The dissimilarity matrices that capture α-diversity and the contemporary measures of β-diversity are in fact *the same species dissmimilarity matrices I refer to here under species dissmilarities*, and on which we will continue to rely on in the subsequent topics as input to many of the ordination techniques.

So, refer back to [Topic 3 - Biodiversity](https://github.com/ajsmit/Quantitative_Ecology/blob/main/jupyter_lab/05-beta_diversity.ipynb) and remind yourselves what that's all about.

To test your understanding of this important topic, please address the following questions and submit next week Monday at 17:00 via GitHub.

### Questions

Using the Doubs species data in [Numerical Ecology with R](https://github.com/ajsmit/Quantitative_Ecology/tree/main/Num_Ecol_R_book_ed1):

> **Question 1:** Look at the dataset and explain its structure in words.

> **Question 2:** Would we use Bray-Curtis or Jaccard dissimilarities?

> **Question 3:** Apply the calculation.

> **Question 4:** Explain the meaning of the results in broad terms.

> **Question 5:** Examine it more closely: what general pattern comes out?

> **Question 6:** Plot this pattern (hint, it is best seen in the 1st column of the dissimilarity matrix).

> **Question 7:** What explanation can you offer for this pattern?

> **Question 8:** Using the `decostand()` function, create presence/absence data, and apply the appropriate `vegdist()` function to obtain a suitable dissimilarity matrix.

> **Question 9:** Create another plot and explain the pattern.
