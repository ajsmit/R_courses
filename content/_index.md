description: This is a website about applications of R in the Earth and Biological
  Sciences. Several R courses taught at the University of the Western Cape Biological
  & Conservation Biology Department are kept here, *viz*. **Introduction to R**,
  **Biostatistics**, and **Quantitative Ecology**. In addition to the taught material,
  there are also pages with some R tricks I have learned over the years, including
  examples of how to analyse oceanographic datasets.
